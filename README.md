# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodgree: Project on Continuous Control

### Project Description

In this project, we train an agent to solve the Reacher Unity environment, in which a double-jointed arm can move to target location. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, to maximize the reward, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible. The environment is solved when the agent achieves an average reward of 30 over 100 consecutive episodes.
